Hey, we're in my dotfiles folder.

I'm currently using wayland/sway and use fish as my login shell, and am on Arch linux.

However, I'm also using the dotfiles on macbooks sometimes, and on my server, which have different setups, hence I have the install.py script with several install path options.

I'm trying to share as much as reasonable between the systems, but fine to create duplicates when that simplifies things.

I really like to keep to standard simple unix tools and tool defaults, because I like simplicity.

I'm OK switching tools when that simplifies things.
